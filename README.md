# Nasa Meteorite Analysis

The analysis is done on NASA's Meteorite Dataset, that can be downloaded from [here](https://data.nasa.gov/view/ak9y-cwf9). In this analysis is done on classes of Meteorite, weight of meteorites & analysis of how many events happened in 10 years period in past 200 years. 

#### Number of recordings grouped by recclass

As there are various classes reported in Datasets, that is same but reported in Capital letters & Small. For removing this ambiguity I changed all classes to small letters. This is the sample result.
